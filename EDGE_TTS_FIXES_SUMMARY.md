# Edge-TTS VPS Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **HTTP 500 Server Error - Rate/Pitch Format** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: VPS API was returning HTTP 500 errors for speed != 1.0  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect rate/pitch parameter format with double signs (`+-10%`)  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed rate format logic: `speed: 0.9` → `rate: "-10%"` (was `"+-10%"`)
- Fixed pitch format logic: `pitch: 1.1` → `pitch: "+10%"` (was `"++10%"`)
- Added proper conditional formatting for positive/negative adjustments

### 2. **Endpoint Configuration Inconsistencies** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple conflicting endpoints (8010 vs 8001)  
**Solution**: 
- Standardized on port 8010 for Edge-TTS VPS
- Updated `AudioApiConfig.edgeTtsBaseUrl` to use correct endpoint
- Port 8001 remains for other services (Coqui TTS)

### 3. **Voice Name Format Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Using full Microsoft voice names instead of ShortNames  
**Root Cause**: API expects `"ar-SA-HamedNeural"` not `"Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (ar-SA, HamedNeural)"`  
**Solution**: 
- Updated `EdgeTtsVoice` enum to use ShortName format
- Added `fullName` getter for backward compatibility
- Fixed voice mapping in all services

### 4. **Response Format Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Expected binary audio data, but API returns JSON with base64  
**Root Cause**: VPS API returns `{"success": true, "audio": "base64data", "format": "mp3"}`  
**Solution**: 
- Changed Dio response type from `ResponseType.bytes` to `ResponseType.json`
- Added base64 decoding logic
- Enhanced error handling for JSON responses

### 5. **UTF-8 Encoding Issues** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
**Problem**: Arabic text encoding issues in HTTP requests  
**Solution**: 
- Added explicit UTF-8 encoding in Content-Type header
- Fixed request header configuration
- French and English synthesis now working perfectly
- Arabic text synthesis may require server-side Edge-TTS configuration

## Files Modified

### `/lib/core/services/audio/edge_tts_service.dart`
```dart
// Key changes:
- Response type: ResponseType.json (was bytes)
- Rate/pitch format: "+10%" (was "110%")
- Voice names: "ar-SA-HamedNeural" (was full Microsoft name)
- Base64 decoding of audio response
- UTF-8 encoding in headers
```

### `/lib/core/services/audio/audio_api_config.dart`
```dart
// Key changes:
- Endpoint: http://168.231.112.71:8010 (confirmed)
- Headers: Removed conflicting Content-Type from default headers
```

### `/lib/core/services/edge_tts_adapter_service.dart`
```dart
// Key changes:
- Better logging for voice mapping
- Enhanced error handling
```

## Validation Results

✅ **French synthesis**: Working perfectly  
✅ **English synthesis**: Working perfectly  
✅ **Rate/pitch parameters**: Working correctly (fixed double-sign bug)  
✅ **JSON response handling**: Working correctly  
✅ **Speed adjustments**: Working correctly (-10% for speed 0.9)
⚠️ **Arabic synthesis**: Server-side configuration issue with Arabic text processing  

## API Format Confirmed

### Request Format:
```json
{
  "text": "Your text here",
  "voice": "fr-FR-DeniseNeural",
  "rate": "+10%",    // Optional, percentage with sign
  "pitch": "+5%"     // Optional, percentage with sign
}
```

### Response Format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "audio": "base64_encoded_mp3_data",
  "format": "mp3",
  "voice": "fr-FR-HenriNeural",
  "rate": "+10%",
  "language": "fr"
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Arabic Text Investigation**: Work with VPS administrator to investigate Edge-TTS engine configuration for Arabic text processing
2. **Voice Configuration**: Confirm all voice variants are properly configured on the VPS
3. **Caching Optimization**: Implement more efficient caching with the new JSON response format
4. **Error Handling**: Add more granular error codes based on API response details

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test French synthesis
curl -X POST "http://168.231.112.71:8010/api/tts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer e828cb8856742db10d4c87bace9889c3795ff63b1343b0ced4b2156113db826a" \
  -d '{"text": "Bonjour", "voice": "fr-FR-DeniseNeural"}'

# Test with parameters
curl -X POST "http://168.231.112.71:8010/api/tts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer e828cb8856742db10d4c87bace9889c3795ff63b1343b0ced4b2156113db826a" \
  -d '{"text": "Test rapide", "voice": "fr-FR-DeniseNeural", "rate": "+20%", "pitch": "+10%"}'
```

## Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL

The Edge-TTS VPS connection is now working correctly for French and English synthesis. The main HTTP 500 errors have been resolved, and the service can generate audio successfully.

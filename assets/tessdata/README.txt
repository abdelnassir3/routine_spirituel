Place Tesseract traineddata files here for Android OCR:

- ara.traineddata (Arabic)
- fra.traineddata (French)

The app copies these into the app's files directory at runtime.
If these files are missing, Tesseract OCR may return empty results.

Download from the official tessdata repository:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best (recommended)
or https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata (faster models)

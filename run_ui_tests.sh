Flutter UI Corrections - Static Analysis Report
============================================

Build Status: FAILED
Timestamp: $(date)

Fixes Implemented:
✓ DropdownMenuItem fix - Resolved import conflicts in reading_session_page.dart
✓ Hands-free controller - Fixed isActuallyArabic scope issue
✓ Hybrid audio service - Fixed detection variable scope in catch blocks

Issues Found:
$(grep -c "Error:" ../build.log 2>/dev/null || echo "0") compilation errors
$(grep -c "No such file" ../build.log 2>/dev/null || echo "0") missing files

Next Steps:
1. Resolve missing import files
2. Fix compilation errors
3. Re-run tests with working build
